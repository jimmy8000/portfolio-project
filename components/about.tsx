        Hello, world! (See what I did there? ðŸ˜‰) <br />
        I'm Jimmy, originally known as Munkhjargal Batsaikhan (but don't stress,
        even I sometimes fumble while spelling it). Born in the majestic
        landscapes of Mongolia, I now wander the digital terrains of coding in
        the US.
      </p>
      <h3>A few things to know about me:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Moniker Master:</strong> While my birth certificate might have
          needed an extended form, most folks just call me Jimmy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Geographical Guru:</strong> I've traveled from the vast
          steppes of Mongolia to the bustling streets of the US.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coding Convert:</strong>I've embarked on the coding caravan
          not so long ago. With a blend of self-study (spoiler: it's tougher
          than it sounds) and a spritz of bootcamp magic, I'm decoding the
          matrix one line at a time.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Catch you in the next &lt;div&gt;!</p>
