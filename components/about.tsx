        Hello, world! (See what I did there? ðŸ˜‰)
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Iâ€™m Jimmy, originally known as Munkhjargal Batsaikhan (but donâ€™t stress, even I sometimes fumble while spelling it). Born in the majestic landscapes of Mongolia, I now navigate the digital terrains of coding in the US.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        My journey from working in a nail salon to web development has given me a unique blend of creativity and precision. Completing a full-stack development bootcamp at CareerFoundry fueled my passion for creating seamless user experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Additionally, my success in singing competitions has enhanced my ability to perform under pressure and connect with audiences. Iâ€™m eager to find opportunities that blend creativity with technology, pushing the boundaries of web design and development.
      </p>

        Catch you in the next &lt;div&gt;!
